# Run this ON the ZimaOS host as root:
#   sh install.sh
# (or, as the unprivileged user:  echo '<password>' | sudo -S sh install.sh)
#
# It installs two pieces and starts the service:
#   1. the sysext module   -> /var/lib/extensions/zfw.raw
#   2. the firewall engine -> /DATA/zfw/zfw   (root:root, 0700)
# then merges the sysext and (re)starts zfw-ui.service. Re-running it
# updates an existing install in place.
